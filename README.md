# Text Editor 
Unit 19 PWA Homework (Modified Edition)

## Description

A simple text editor that can be used online or offline, either within a browser or detached from the browser like an app.

It uses "Progressive Web Apps" to deliver a quick, responsive experience.

## Installation

Contains "client" and "server" directories

At command line using top-level directory, run the following command

`>npm install`
`>npm start`

## How to Test

As you develop, you can run things using `npm start:dev`. When you think you have everything completed, then run `npm start`. This will initiate the build process. The app will then be running on port 3000. You'll see a button in the header of the app where you can install it as a PWA. Try it out!

Once everything works locally, deploy to Heroku and test again. You can even test on a mobile device if you want.

If you need to start from scratch and remove the existing PWA:

- Close the standalone browser window containing the PWA
- Delete the PWA from your hard drive 
- Kill the server session running in VS Code 
- In Chrome, go to localhost:3000, the app may or may not open again. If it does, open up the dev console, go to Application -> Service Workerss and click the **Unregister Worker** link.
